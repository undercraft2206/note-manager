# 🧠 Note Management System
The Note Management System is a C-based application designed to manage notes by calculating the average of a series of input notes. The program prompts the user to input the note format and subsequent notes, ensuring that each note does not exceed the specified format. It then calculates and displays the average note, continuously updating the average as more notes are input. This project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to manage notes, making it easier to track and analyze notes over time.

## 🚀 Features
- Calculates the average of a series of input notes
- Prompts the user to input the note format and subsequent notes
- Ensures that each note does not exceed the specified format
- Continuously updates the average note as more notes are input
- Displays the new average note after each update

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
